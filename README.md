# Quote deCode

## A game about decoding quotes!
All the famous quotes in the world have been scrambled, and only you (and maybe your friends) can bring them back

You'll still be able to read the quotes, but not all the words are the same. Some are red (synonyms) and some are blue (rhyming words), and you need to figure out what they originally meant. 

Click on each encoded word to see potential other synonyms or rhymes, but watch outâ€”you might lose some points.

Stuck on a tricky word? Hit the cheat button! It will cost you, but at least you'll be able to decode the whole quote.
